<h1>What is a Preprocessor</h1>
<p>The C preprocessor modifies a source code file before handing it over to the compiler.</p>
<p>Besides using the preprocessor to include files directly into other files, or #define constants, but the preprocessor can also be used to create "inlined" code using macros expanded at compile time and to prevent code from being compiled twice.</p>
