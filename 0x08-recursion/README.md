<h1>What is Recursion Or Recursive?</h1>
<p>In computer programming, the term recursive describes a function or method that repeatedly calculates a smaller part of itself to arrive at the final result. It is similar to iteration, but instead of repeating a set of operations, a recursive function accomplishes repetition by referring to itself in its own definition.</p>
