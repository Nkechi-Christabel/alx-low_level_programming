def island_perimeter(grid):
    """
    Calculate the perimeter of the island described in the grid.

    Args:
    - grid (List[List[int]]): A list of lists representing the island grid.
      0 represents a water zone, and 1 represents a land zone.

    Returns:
    - int: The perimeter of the island.

    Constraints:
    - Grid is rectangular, with width and height not exceeding 100.
    - Grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is one island
    (or nothing).
    - The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to
    the water around the island).
