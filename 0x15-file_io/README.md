<h1>File I/O</h1>
<p>System calls are the calls that a program makes to the system kernel to provide the services to which the program does not have direct access. For example, providing access to input and output devices such as monitors and keyboards. We can use various functions provided in the C Programming language for input/output system calls such as create, open, read, write, etc.</p>
<h2>What is the File Descriptor?</h2>
<p>In Unix type systems, a file descriptor (fd for short) is a small positive integer used as reference to an open file in a process. The file descriptor is an integer that uniquely identifies an open file of the process.</p>
